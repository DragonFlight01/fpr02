            <p>The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test
                 that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20
                  meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.
                   The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute
                    after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be
                     completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to
                      run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The
                       second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound,
                        your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.
                         On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding</p>

            <p>Latino (masculine) and Latina (feminine) as a noun refer to people from Latin America. The term Hispanic usually includes Spaniards whereas Latino as a noun often does not. Latino/Latina may include Brazilians, Spaniards and sometimes even some European romanophones such as Portuguese (a usage sometimes found in bilingual subgroups within the U.S., borrowing from how the word is defined in Spanish), but Hispanic does not include any of those other than Spaniards.</p>

Oh, and even better, Tanisha will call your dog's ass if she stops having sex with the brain surgeon or lawyer she's having sex with. friend</p>
